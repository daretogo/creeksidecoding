Alright guys and gals 

You should remember your homework from class, but it was:

- Find 3 different websites that have some interesting data on it you can "scrape".   Ideas:  quotes, recipies, sports scores, weather
- Use the Week8 HW Code to download the code for those 3 websites
- Scroll through the code and find the interesting part from the website (hint:  use the "find" function to look for keywords!)

Next week we're gonna learn how to filter all that data from the websites and get just the part we want.
