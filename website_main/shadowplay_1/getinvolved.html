        <h2>How To Get Involved With us:</h2>
        <p>We will be hosting an "open house" where you can come visit us during the month of May we have many opportunities for you and your family to come visit and see how we run our classes and meet new friends. If you get interested in joining us you will get a packet of information to fill out so your child or children can enroll the following year! <strong></strong> <strong></strong></p>
        <h2>   Church Requirements: <a href="http://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk"></a></h2>
        <p>Because this Co-op is using the Creekside Community Church we use up quite a bit of their toilet paper, paper towels, Etc.<a href="examples.html"></a>          Requirements for Joining: 
        - 1 roll of paper towels - 1 package of toilet paper (about nine rolls) - 1 ream of paper (these donations occur in the middle of the year and towards the end.)</p>

There is some available supplies at the co-op, however most items needed for classes will either need to be purchased by you or ask the parents of your students to buy them.</p>
