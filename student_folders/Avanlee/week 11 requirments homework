# Let's talk requirements! 

# 1. Understanding the Project Requirements 📋
# First, we need to outline what our application must do. This is like creating a recipe for our code! Here's what we've got:

# Input: the user must input the date for that day but NOT THE HOLIDAY DATE! 
# Output: the computer should output the holiday and not the ones in the past.  

# 2. Date Tracking and Parsing
So for example if the date the user imputs is equal ways away from two different varrible holidays then you would chosse the one that the month numbers are larger. 

# Current Date: the current date and the input date soposed to be the same
# Input Date: 

# 3. Comparing Dates 🔍
you must pick the one in the future


# 4. Displaying the Recipe 🥘
probably their should be a url which applies to the input

#????  

# While Loop: We can use 
# What if someone types in an invalid date? We need to handle such situations gracefully.

# List of Requirements: Write down everything our application needs to do. Think about the inputs, outputs, and special cases.
# Program Structure Thoughts: Discuss with your team how we should structure our program. How do we keep it running? How do we handle different inputs?
