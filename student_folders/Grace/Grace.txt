Here is my recipe for Valentine's Day cake pops. I think this goes well with the whole Valentine's Day idea because you can make these with red velvet cake and frost them with red, white, and pink icing and coat them with cutsie-pootsie sprinkles. My idea for the name of our program is Yummy Holiday Recipes.
