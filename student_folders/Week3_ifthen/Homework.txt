Assignment: Create a Simple Quiz Game

Objective: Build a Python program that quizzes the user with multiple-choice questions and provides feedback on their answers.

Requirements:

The program should ask the user their name and greet them personally.
Create at least three multiple-choice questions related to a topic of your choice (e.g., science, history, or a favorite book). Each question should have three answer options.
Use if/then statements to check if the user's answers are correct.
Keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz.
Provide feedback to the user for each question, indicating whether their answer was correct or not.
Use f-strings to personalize the feedback with the user's name.



Here is an example of what the OUTPUT of your game should look like:
