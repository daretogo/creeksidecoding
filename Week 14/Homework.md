Please describe the web pages in as much detail as you can imagine them. 
If you suggest a feature that requires data, try to gather as much of that data as possible (Example:  if you want to create a page with contact details of all the teachers, then go ahead and gather up that information)
- Describe the page layout in as much detail as possible.  If you are able, feel free to create an image/picture of how you would imagine the layout.  A hand drawn sketch would be perfectly fine!
