# Launching VScode and navigating files within it

# Let's Pick a template! 

https://www.html5webtemplates.co.uk/templates/,  I liked "Simplestyle Banner" from this one. 


# Download the template, start hacking!
Once we pick a template,  I will download it, unpack it, and place it in the "Week15" folder.
You all will need to do a "git pull" 


Then we can start customizing it to our liking
