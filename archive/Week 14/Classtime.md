# Transition time

We've covered the basic foundations of programming with variables, data-types, if/when loops and conditionals. 

Now our goal is shifting to spend the next third of our classes on the internet, web hosting, and web pages.


# Install visual studio code 

We're going to "rate limit" everyone from installing all at the same time.  Half then the other half. 

wifi name:   "wifi-aaron"
wifi password:   "7202819561"  

```
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install code -y
```
When that completes, you should then have "Visual Studio Code" in your main menu under "Programming" 
alternately you can launch it from terminal by typing "code ." 


# Basics of a web page

Ref, example.html.  We'll cover:
-DOCTYPE
-Head
-Body
-<H#> tags
-Colors
-Attributes / Links / images
-Center
-Div


# Our project for this web focused unit

Now that you've seen some of the very basic elements of a web page you might be able to imagine how someone could use a combination of these building blocks to create a design on a web page that they like. 

We're going to tackle exactly that, creating a website for our Creekside Community Co-Op. 

## What does it mean to "host" a website? 
Like your HTML file lives on your local raspberry pi, the HTML files for your websites have to "live" somewhere.  That "somewhere" is a webserver.  The webserver will provide the HTML file to the browser of anybody who asks for it allowing you to view that website.  

The homework for this week focuses on becoming familiar with how this works, there are many processes involed from DNS to the OSI network model and the HTTPS layer which allows our communication with a webserver to be secure. 

## So... what information would be useful on our creekside website?

## What specific information should be on these pages?    Things like phone numbers, meeting times / location, names of leaders,  purpose, vision statement?  Calendars / schedules? 

You students and your parents are the ideal users for this website. 
What would be useful to you or your parents to have easily accessible?
