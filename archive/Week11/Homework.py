## In class this week we got our github accounts configured and able to upload code. 
## This weeks homework you should create a new file in your student_folder
## and then add, commit, and push your homework up to github.

## If you want to verify it worked, you can go to https://github.com/daretogo/creeksidecoding and browse the code, and you should see your homework file
## there inside your student_folder.  If you don't see it there after pushing, something went wrong. 


## This weeks homework is about REQUIREMENTS. 
## Requirements are how we think through what a software program needs to do. 
## We define what we "require" it to do. 

## Starting at line 86 in the ClassExample.py is a structure for thinking about requirements. 

## You could copy from line 86 to the end and paste it into your new homework file, then add more details and research. 
## You could even create a "it should look like this"  section and type out what you think the presentation should be.
