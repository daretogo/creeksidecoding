# The goal for last week was to get you more comfortable with git
# and to work on the requirements for our program.

## Now that we're more comfortable with git, let's each upload our requirements.


# First, your requirements should be located inside your student folder.
# If you created that file anywhere else, go move it now into your student folder. 

# Let's all run the command "git status"

# THe output of "git status" will tell us what changes git is currently tracking.


#### IMPORTANT #####

#  if you have any files that are listed under "Changes not staged for commit:" that are NOT in your student folder
#  then we need to get back the original copy of those items.
#  You can run

# git checkout HEAD -- file.txt

# replacing "file.txt" with the full path of the file that you want to revert to original version.


###  CHECKPOINT:
# Everyone run "git status" from inside your creeksidecoding folder,
# and revert all the changes EXCEPT your change from your student file.



### PUSH IT GOOD

# Ok, now that we've gotten everybody on the same page and everyone can run a "git status" and they only files they see listed
# are the ones in their own student folder we can move forward with doing a commit.

# git add --all
# git commit -m "Message about the files that you are uploading"
# git push

###################

# Now, I am going to do a "git pull" in order to retrieve all of the files you guys just uploaded
# and we are going to review the "requirements" comments and notes that you all made and produce our own requirements
# document.



#####  HOMEWORK

# The homework this week I am going to create tonight after reading all your requirements.   I am going to create a guided
# walk through with notes on each requirement and to provide code-prompts and hints.
