# ClassExample.py

# Welcome to today's coding class. In addition to our usual week-by-week folders, 
# we have introduced a new folder in our class GitHub repository named "student_folders".
# This folder contains a sub-folder for each student in the class.

# Inside each student's folder, you will find the answer they provided for last week's homework. 
# This includes a link to a recipe and an explanation of how the food relates to the holiday they were assigned.

# Today's goal is to organize this data into a structured format. We will create variables 
# that store ordered lists, each representing key information about the holiday and the associated food.

# Let's think about the key items or data points we want for each holiday/food combination.
# We need to know the name of the holiday, the student who researched it, the date of the holiday, 
# the URL of the recipe, and the student's explanation of the food's relevance to the holiday.

# We can represent this data using an ordered list stored in a variable. Here's an example:
holiday_data = ["holiday_name", "student_name", "holiday_date", "recipe_URL", "relevance_explanation", "recipe_advice"]

# During today's class, you will have some time to review each person's file in the repository.
# Your task is to create a series of variables like 'holiday_data' for each entry. 
# Store this information in a new file within your student folder in the repository.

### 15 Minutes Worktime ### 

# Once you have created these data sets, we will proceed to the next step, which involves 
# committing your changes to the repository. For this, we need to ensure each of you has a GitHub account and can commit to the creeksidecoding repo from your raspberry pi's. 


# If you do not have a GitHub account yet, we will guide you through the process of creating one.
# Afterwards, each student will be added as a collaborator to the class repository. 
# This will allow you to push your changes and make your contributions visible to everyone.

# Remember, the skills you are learning today are not just about coding, 
# but also about using tools like GitHub for collaboration and version control â€“ essential skills for any developer.

# Good luck, and let's start coding!
