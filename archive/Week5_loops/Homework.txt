Assignment: Create a Simple Number Guessing Game

Objective: To create a Python program that allows a player to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.

Requirements:

The program should generate a random number between 1 and 100 (you can adjust the range as needed).
The player should be allowed to guess the number.
If the player's guess is too low, the program should inform them and allow them to guess again.
If the player's guess is too high, the program should inform them and allow them to guess again.
If the player's guess is correct, the program should congratulate them and display the number of attempts it took.
The program should keep track of the number of attempts the player has made.
The game should continue until the player guesses the correct number.
OPTIONALLY: After the game is won, ask the player if they want to play again. If they do, generate a new random number and reset the attempts counter. If they don't, end the game.
Hints:

Use a while loop to keep the game running until the player wins or decides to quit.
You can use the random module in Python to generate random numbers.
You can use an if statement to compare the player's guess with the random number and provide feedback.
You'll need a counter to keep track of the number of attempts.
You can use an input() function to get the player's guess and use int() to convert it to an integer.
Example Output (Partial):

EXAMPLE OUTPUT: 

----------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.

Take a guess: 50
Too low! Try again.

Take a guess: 75
Too high! Try again.

Take a guess: 63
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): no
Thanks for playing!
