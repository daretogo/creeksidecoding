# Setup PINS for the LEDs. We're using Broadcom pin mode, so these are GPIO numbers, not physical pin numbers.
red_led =    
green_led =  
blue_led =  
## NOTE:  The one-wire pin is GPIO pin 4 on the raspberry pi.  That's where the signal line from the temp sensor goes.  GPIO 4. 

# Initialize GPIO for LED control
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)  # Use Broadcom pin numbering
GPIO.setwarnings(False)  # Disable warnings for GPIO setup
# Setup each LED pin as an output
GPIO.setup(red_led, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(green_led, GPIO.OUT)
GPIO.setup(blue_led, GPIO.OUT)

# Function to read temperature from DS18B20 sensor
def read_temp():
    sensor = DS18B20()  # Create an instance of the DS18B20 class
    temperature = sensor.get_temperature()  # Read the temperature
    return temperature

# Function to control LEDs based on temperature
def control_leds(temp):
    # If temperature is below 65, turn the blue LED on and others off (too cold)


## example of the code to turn on the blue LED.  From this example you should be able to figure out how to turn on/off any of the 3 LEDs:     
        GPIO.output(blue_led, GPIO.HIGH)
        GPIO.output(red_led, GPIO.LOW)
        GPIO.output(green_led, GPIO.LOW)


# Main loop to repeatedly read temperature and update LEDs
while True:
    # Read the current temperature
    # Print the temperature
    # Update LEDs based on the temperature
    # Wait for 3 seconds before the next read
