We're following this tutorial to get our display working: 

The table that maps the pins to which pins on the pi GPIO there is especially important.

OLED Pin	Pi GPIO Pin	Notes
Vcc	  1            	3.3V
Gnd	  14          	Ground
SCL	  SCL1          I2C SCL
SDA	  SDA1          I2C SCA

Enable I2C Interface

The I2C interface is disabled by default so you need to enable it. You can do this within the raspi-config tool on the command line by running :

sudo raspi-config

(interfaces -> i2c)


After wiring up the display: 

i2cdetect -y 1



git@github.com:adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306.git

cd into new folder

sudo python ./setup.py install

cd examples

python ./stats.py


now we can go back to the "simple_display.py" in the Week24 folder to see how we can change out the words we print to the screen. 
















Notes: 

sudo apt-get install python-smbus
sudo apt-get install i2c-tools
